# DeepL node

Use the DeepL node to automate work in DeepL, and integrate DeepL with other applications. n8n has built-in support for a wide range of DeepL features, including translating languages.

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the DeepL node supports and links to more resources.

> **Credentials**
>
> Refer to [DeepL credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/deepl.md) for guidance on setting up authentication.

> **This node can be used as an AI tool**
>
> This node can be used to enhance the capabilities of an AI agent. When used in this way, many parameters can be set automatically, or with information directed by AI - find out more in the [AI tool parameters documentation](/advanced-ai/examples/using-the-fromai-function.md).

## What to do if your operation isn't supported

If this node doesn't support the operation you want to do, you can use the [HTTP Request node](https://docs.n8n.io//) to call the service's API.

You can use the credential you created for this service in the HTTP Request node: 

1. In the HTTP Request node, select **Authentication** > **Predefined Credential Type**.
1. Select the service you want to connect to.
1. Select your credential.

Refer to [Custom API operations](/integrations/custom-operations.md) for more information.
