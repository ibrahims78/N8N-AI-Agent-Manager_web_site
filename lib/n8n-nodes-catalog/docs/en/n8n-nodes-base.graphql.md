# GraphQL

[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) is an open-source data query and manipulation language for APIs, and a runtime for fulfilling queries with existing data. Use the GraphQL node to query a GraphQL endpoint.

## Node parameters

> **This node can be used as an AI tool**
>
> This node can be used to enhance the capabilities of an AI agent. When used in this way, many parameters can be set automatically, or with information directed by AI - find out more in the [AI tool parameters documentation](https://docs.n8n.io/advanced-ai/examples/using-the-fromai-function/).

### Authentication

Select the type of authentication to use.

If you select anything other than **None**, the **Credential for <selected-auth-type>** parameter appears for you to select an existing or create a new authentication credential for that authentication type.

### HTTP Request Method

Select the underlying HTTP Request method the node should use. Choose from:

* **GET**
* **POST**: If you select this method, you'll also need to select the **Request Format** the node should use for the query payload. Choose from:
    * **GraphQL (Raw)**
    * **JSON**

Refer to [Related Resources](#related-resources) for information on writing your query.

### Response Format

Select the format you'd like to receive query results in. Choose between:
