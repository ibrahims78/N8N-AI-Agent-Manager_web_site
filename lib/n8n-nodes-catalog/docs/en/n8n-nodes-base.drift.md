## What to do if your operation isn't supported

If this node doesn't support the operation you want to do, you can use the [HTTP Request node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/index.md) to call the service's API.

You can use the credential you created for this service in the HTTP Request node: 

1. In the HTTP Request node, select **Authentication** > **Predefined Credential Type**.
1. Select the service you want to connect to.
1. Select your credential.
